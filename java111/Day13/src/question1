==> Dynamic polymorphism :- Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is to resolve at runtime rather than compile time.

==> Dynamic binding :- When the compiler resolves the method call binding during the execution of the program is known as Dynamic binding or late binding.
