==> checked exception:
    * They occur at compile time.
    * The compiler checks for a checked exception.
    * The JVM requires that the exception be caught and handled.

==> unchecked exception:
    * These exceptions occur at runtime.
    * The compiler doesn't check for these kinds of exceptions.
    * he JVM doesn't requires the exception to be caught and handles.
