ans==> *overloading==> It helps to increase readability of the program. overloading method is a compile time polymorphism. It occurs within the class.
        example:
        class Overloading {
            static int add(int a, intb) {
                return a+b;
            }
            static int add(int a,int b, int c){
                return a+b+c;
            }
        }

       *overriding==> overriding method is a run time polymorphism. It is performed two class inheritance relationships. Method overriding always needs inheritance.
       example:
       class Animal{
            void running() {
            System.out.println("running");
            }
            class tiger extends Animal{

                void running() {
                    System.out,println("sleeping");
                }
            }
       }
